# Data-Mining
Computer assignments of "Data Mining" Course ar University of Tehran

The course had three main exercises or mini-projects:
## 1- Blood Transfusion Service center Data Set EDA
Download Blood Transfusion Service Center Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository and run a full explanaroty data analysis and data visualization on it. Check number of features and create box plots and acatter plots in order to analize the dataset.
Find out which feature is best candidate for data classification.
## 2- Classification and Principle Component Analysis
  ### Part 1 (Maternal Health Risk Data Set Data Set): Load the dataset and divide it into features and labels. Encode the labels in order to change categorical data to ordinal nubmers.
  Shuffle the data and split it into train and test sets with 70% to 30% ratio. Implement data preprocessing it it's necessary.
  Implement classification with each of these models: Decision Tree, KNN, SVM, Random Foret. Find out the best parameters of these models with cross validation and print confusion matrix for each model.
  ### Part 2 (Parkinson's Disease Classification Data Set): Implement all the tasks of Part 1. Use PCA for feature extraction and train models on new features. Find out the best PC value and their the effect of number of PCs on the accuracy of models.
